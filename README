This repository contains all these firmware images which have been
extracted from older drivers, as well various new firmware images which
we were never permitted to include in a GPL'd work, but which we _have_
been permitted to redistribute under separate cover.

To submit firmware to this repository, please send either a git binary
diff or preferably a git pull request to:
      linux-firmware@kernel.org
and also cc: to related mailing lists.

If your commit adds new firmware, it must update the WHENCE and WHENCE.yaml
files to clearly state the license under which the firmware is available, and
that it is redistributable. Being redistributable includes ensuring
the firmware license provided includes an implicit or explicit
patent grant to end users to ensure full functionality of device
operation with the firmware. If the license is long and involved, it's
permitted to include it in a separate file and refer to it from the
WHENCE and WHENCE.yaml files ('See LICENSE.foo for details.').
And if it were possible, a changelog of the firmware itself.

Run 'make check' and './linux-firmware.py check' to check that WHENCE is
consistent with the repository contents.

Ideally, your commit should contain a Signed-Off-By: from someone
authoritative on the licensing of the firmware in question (i.e. from
within the company that owns the code).

WHENCE.yaml file
================

WHENCE.yaml file is YAML 1.2 compliant file with structured data about
firmware files. Particular entry as follows:

  - # Name of entry, usually the name of the module that loads firmware
    name: rtl8xxxu
    # Description of entry
    description: Realtek 802.11n WLAN driver for RTL8XXX USB devices
    # List of categories where module resides
    category:
      - drivers/net/wireless
    # Vendor of firmware or device
    vendor: Realtek
    # License entry
    license:
      # Name of license file; May be "Redistributable" (if no license file)
      # or "Unknown" (if redistribution status is unknown)
      name: LICENCE.rtlwifi_firmware.txt
      # Optional: Copyright notice
      copyright: >
        Copyright (c) 2010, Realtek Semiconductor Corporation. All rights
        reserved.
      # Optional: Additional info for license information. If no license file,
      # add here cause for permission to distribute. Add
      # SPDX-License-Identifier (https://spdx.dev/ids/) if applicable
      info: Redistributable
    # Some descriptive information about firmware
    info: |
      rtl8723au taken from Realtek driver
      rtl8723A_WiFi_linux_v4.1.3_6044.20121224
      Firmware is embedded in the driver as data statements. This info has
      been extracted into a binary file.
    # List of firmware files
    files:
      - # Filename
        name: rtlwifi/rtl8723aufw_A.bin
        # Optional: version of firmware
        version: "35.7"
        # Optional: additional information about particular file
        info: Taken from old version
        # Optional: If there sources for firmware, add them as list here
        source:
          - rtlwifi/src/
      - name: rtlwifi/rtl8192eu_nic.bin
      - name: rtlwifi/rtl8723bs_nic.bin
    # Optional: List of symlinks for being installed. Please note, link should
    # point to file from directory where link being placed, i.e.:
    # rtlwifi/rtl8192eefw.bin -> rtl8192eu_nic.bin is means that in directory
    # rtlwifi will be created rtl8192eefw.bin that points to rtl8192eu_nic.bin
    # in that directory
    links:
      - # Symlink name
        name: rtlwifi/rtl8192eefw.bin
        # Target filename, it should exists
        target: rtl8192eu_nic.bin

After adding entry run './firmware-install.py check' to verify correctness
of entry.

If firmware files comes with different licenses and/or different sources, add
them in separate entries (see './firmware-install.py info -n ti_usb_3410_5052'
or './firmware-install.py info -n cxgb3' as example).


WARNING:
=======

Don't send any "CONFIDENTIALITY STATEMENT" in your e-mail, patch or
request. Otherwise your firmware _will never be accepted_.

Maintainers are really busy, so don't expect a prompt reply.
